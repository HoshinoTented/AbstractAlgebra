We know there are $a!$ permutations of $a$ elements,
we may rethink it in another way. We think $a!$ is the possibilities of the way
that you pick $a$ elements from $a$ elements.
Now, we can generailize the first $a$, that is, pick $k$ elements from $n$ elements.
It's easy to see that it is exactly $n!$ but only first $k$ terms, that is, $\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$.

If we don't care about the order, we may divide $\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$ by the
amount of the permutations of $k$ elements, that is $k!$.

We may denote pick $k$ elements in $n$ elements (without order) by $C^n_k$,
which is exactly $\frac{n!}{(n - k)! k!}$.
